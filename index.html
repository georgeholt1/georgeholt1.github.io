    Hi, I'm George, a physics PhD researcher, data enthusiast and AI
    practitioner.
</p>

<p>
    I write posts about data analysis and visualisation, productivity, machine
    learning, and other interesting problems. My posts are listed below
    sorted by recency, <a href="/year-archive/">here</a> sorted by year, and
    <a href="/categories/">here</a> sorted by category.
</p>

<p>
    A semi-regularly-updated page containing some of my data visualisation is
    located <a href="/data-visualisations/">here</a>.
