<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>

    <p>
        I am currently a Senior Artificial Intelligence Researcher at the <a href="https://www.hartree.stfc.ac.uk/">STFC Hartree Centre</a> (STFC, UK). My work involves full-stack applied AI research:
        <ul style="line-height: 1.4; margin-top: -20px;">
            <li>Machine learning research applied to the physical sciences (nuclear fusion for energy generation, materials discovery for carbon capture and sequestration, small molecule discovery for drug application, etc.);</li>
            <li>Artificial intelligence research (deep learning, hyperparameter optimisation, active learning, reinforcement learning, etc.);</li>
            <li>Training machine learning models at scale on high-performance computing and cloud infrastructure;</li>
            <li>Explaining and interpreting machine learning model behaviour and predictions;</li>
            <li>Data analysis, engineering and visualisation;</li>
            <li>Developing and using numerical simulation models of physical systems (tokamak fusion reactor scrape-off layer and divertor, tokamak plasma shape).</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        I regularly publish my work in internationally leading conferences and journals in AI and physical sciences venues and have received several awards for research excellence.
    </p>

    <p>
        I received a PhD in Physics from the University of Strathclyde in 2022, a masters in Fusion Energy with distinction and project prize from the University of York in 2018, and an undergraduate degree in Physics from the University of Glasgow in 2017.
